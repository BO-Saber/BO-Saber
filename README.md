I'm Soumyajit Datta — a student innovator, backend strategist, and cyber rebel.

🌐 Director of ISF, uniting global youth through tech, community, and justice

🕵️‍♂️ Commander of BlackOps, exposing scams, phishing rings, and fake propaganda

🎓 Mentor and team lead in global hackathons, youth cyber workshops, and developer circles

⚔️ Red & Blue team architect, building both attacks and defenses with Python

🤖 Believer in AI, open knowledge, and power through code

🔍 Long Bio

⚙️ Background & Roots

From the day I wrote my first print("Hello World"), I knew that I didn’t want to just consume technology — I wanted to use it to expose truth, build shields, and light fires of change. My journey began in classrooms and evolved into digital battlefields. I was never just a developer — I was a watcher, strategist, and builder.

🕸️ The BlackOps Mission

BlackOps isn't just a cool name — it's a digital frontline. We:

⚫ Build tools to counteract scams and phishing attacks

🧪 Run forensic analysis on suspicious URLs and server behavior

🧠 Use AI to identify deepfakes and fake narratives

🗡️ Engage in ethical disruption against malicious infrastructures

My role is to coordinate ops, manage intelligence scripts, and build systems that auto-respond to threat patterns.

💡 ISF — International Students' Federation

My leadership at ISF is focused on:

🌍 Empowering youth with tech skills and critical thinking

🤝 Uniting diverse minds across continents under one mission

🏧 Hosting global-level workshops, hackathons, and awareness events

📈 Leading tech + activism as one collaborative platform

We are not just a student body — we are a force for social and digital reform.

🔬 AI Research Direction

As part of my roadmap, I’ve been:

Using LLMs to summarize CVEs and threat reports

Experimenting with ML models to detect fake media

Extracting heuristics from large text data to detect anomalies

AI isn’t a toy. It’s my magnifying glass — to zoom into lies, distortions, and silent signals buried in data.

💬 My Philosophy

“Hacking is not about breaking — it's about understanding systems better than anyone else, and using that power ethically.”

I live by:

Code with courage

Share knowledge, not just builds

Hack for good, not for glory
